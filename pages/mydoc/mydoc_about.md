My name is Erick Vazquez since i was 10 years old I have been using computer all my life, so i had to find a way to store and share all that information that gets lost in time in order to preserve it and share it I started with a single [technical writing blog](http://idratherbewriting.com) and my [course on API documentation](http://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/).  See [my blog's about page](http://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/) for more details about me.

I have used this theme and variations of it for various documentation projects. This theme has undergone several major iterations, and now it's fairly stable and full of all the features that I need. You are welcome to use it for your documentation projects for free.
