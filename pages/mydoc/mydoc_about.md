I started with a single [personal webpage](https://vazeri.github.io/) and my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vazeri). You can also read my [blog](https://vazeri.github.io/cueva-digital/news) for more details about me.

My name is Erick Vazquez since I was 10 years old, I have been using computer all my life, so I had to find a way to store valuable information. 

This webpage contains Information, documents, advice and files that I consider valuable share on a daily basis and that i have written or found along the way.

I am sure more than one will be useful in order to preserve it and share it with others,
