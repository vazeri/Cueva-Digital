## Build the Theme

Follow these instructions to build the theme.

### 1. Download the theme

First, download or clone the theme from the [Github repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll). Most likely you won't be pulling in updates once you start customizing the theme, so downloading the theme (instead of cloning it) probably makes the most sense. In Github, click the **Clone or download** button, and then click **Download ZIP**.

### 2. Install Jekyll

If you've never installed or run a Jekyll site locally on your computer, follow these instructions to install Jekyll:

* [Install Jekyll on Mac][mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac]
## Other instructions

The content here is just a getting started guide only. For other details in working with the theme, see the various sections in the sidebar.
